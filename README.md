# BISI Project - Diabetes Analysis

## Overview

In the context of the Pima tribe that this project was conducted to gain insights into prevelances, risk factors as woman can be pregnant and its impacts.

## Using

* Python 3.9.13
* Jupiter Notebook 6.5.2

## Objectives

* Explore data analysis in the Pima tribe to study different perspectives of diabetes.

## Data Sources

The data used in this analysis was recorded on 768 members of the Pima tribe. It also includes number of pregnancies, details on various medical and the age of women, so we can track their issues by age.

## Analysis Techniques

A research was conducted on  a tribe in America, and it was showed that women are predisposed to diabetes at an early age. For that our purpose, is to analyse different aspects of Diabetes. First, we should recognise and maintain a good understanding for the dataset information. We may use descriptive statistics, as well as we can use summary statistics, such as means, medians, and standard deviations, to explain how the dataset's variables are distributed. Then, we used different charts to understand the correlation between  the some features, for example we plotted a scatterplot between Glucose and Insulin. We can agreed that the two variables have a positive linear connection. Finally, we trained the Model.
